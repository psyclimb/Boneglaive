DELPHIC APPRAISER

ASCII Representation: A

  Base Stats: 20 HP, 3 ATK, 1 DEF, 3 Move Range, 2 Attack Range

  Passive - Valuation Oracle:
  The DELPHIC APPRAISER perceives the "cosmic value" of furniture terrain (coat racks, ottomans, tables) - a mystical
  numerical value (1-9) randomly assigned when first observed. Unlike the GAS MACHINIST who creates persistent entities,
  the APPRAISER temporarily alters existing terrain. When standing adjacent to appraised furniture, gains +1 to defense
  and attack range, allowing tactical repositioning.

  Animation Effect: When appraising furniture, ancient numerical glyphs briefly materialize above it, settling into a
  permanent value that glows whenever the APPRAISER is nearby. The furniture itself temporarily transforms, revealing
  ornate, hidden detailing that corresponds to its value.

  Active Skills:

  1. Market Futures (M):
  Infuses a furniture piece within range 4 with temporal investment energy, allowing the APPRAISER to "trade" on its
  future value. Creates a one-time teleportation anchor that any ally can activate when within range 2 of the furniture.
  When used, the ally teleports to any position within range equal to the furniture's cosmic value. Higher values (7-9)
  also grant the teleported ally +1 to all stats for 1 turn.

  Animation Effect: The APPRAISER touches the furniture, causing temporal market projections to spiral around it. The
  furniture transforms into a more valuable future version of itself, gleaming with investment potential. When an ally
  activates the teleport, they're momentarily converted into golden market arrows that arc through the air before
  reforming at the destination.

  2. Auction Curse (A):
  Subjects an enemy within range 3 to a "cosmic auction" where their capabilities are bid away. Unlike the GAS
  MACHINIST's area denial, this directly transforms enemy strengths into tactical advantages. The enemy loses stats based
   on the cosmic value of nearby furniture: Low values (1-3) remove 1 attack; medium values (4-6) also remove 1 range;
   high values (7-9) additionally remove 1 movement. For each stat point removed, the APPRAISER gains a "bid token" that
  can be awarded to any ally within range 3, granting them +1 to the corresponding stat for 2 turns.

  Animation Effect: The APPRAISER creates an auction podium with the cosmic value prominently displayed. Spectral
  furniture pieces appear as bidders, raising paddles to claim portions of the enemy's power. With each successful bid, a
   stat attribute visibly transfers from the enemy to the APPRAISER in the form of glowing tokens, which then float to
  the designated ally.

  3. Divine Depreciation (D):
  Dramatically reappraises a furniture piece within range 3 as "cosmically worthless," creating a reality distortion in a
  3Ã—3 area. Unlike the GAS MACHINIST's damaging vapors, this skill manipulates the tactical landscape itself. The
  furniture piece sinks into the floor, creating a depression that alters battlefield positioning. Enemies caught in the
  area take 2 damage plus the furniture's cosmic value, and suffer -1 to attack and skill range (minimum 1) for 2 turns,
  while allies gain +1 to attack and skill range while in the area.

  Animation Effect: The APPRAISER makes a dramatic downward valuation gesture. The furniture's cosmic value rapidly drops
  to zero as the piece itself appears to age centuries in seconds. The floor around it warps and sinks, creating a
  depression filled with failed investment certificates and devalued market assets. Enemies in this sunken area find their
  reach diminished, their attacks and abilities visibly shortened by the distorted valuation space. Meanwhile, allies seem
  to extend above the depression, gaining superior position and greater reach as they capitalize on the market collapse.
