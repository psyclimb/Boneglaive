# Description:
# - Central circular pit (7x7 with rounded corners) surrounded by limestone walls
# - Strategic furniture placement optimized for DELPHIC_APPRAISER skills
# - Symmetrical design both horizontally and vertically for balanced gameplay
# - Roughly 40% of floor has light lime dusting (visual only, passable)

# Strategic Furniture Clusters:
# 1. Corner clusters (good for Divine Depreciation)
#    - All four corners have furniture groupings with different types
#    - Allows for maximum tactical advantage when using area effects
# 
# 2. Perimeter teleportation points (for Market Futures skill)
#    - Furniture placed at cardinal points around the map
#    - Enables teleportation networks from multiple angles
#    - Each piece has clear line of sight to others
#
# 3. Inner tactical ring (for Auction Curse positioning)
#    - Furniture placed near the central pit
#    - Allows for strategic positioning for curse effects
#    - Good lines of sight to both the pit center and corners
#
# 4. Central pit furniture (high-risk, high-reward positions)
#    - Two ottomans inside the pit boundary
#    - Creates tactical advantages for aggressive play
#    - Forces interesting decision-making for players

# Tactical Considerations:
# - The central pit creates a natural focal point for combat
# - Furniture density is optimized for DELPHIC_APPRAISER abilities
# - Circular design encourages movement around the pit edge
# - Multiple movement paths prevent bottlenecks
# - Symmetry ensures neither player has a terrain advantage
# - Furniture placement creates varied cosmic values across the map

# Gameplay Impact:
# - DELPHIC_APPRAISER can utilize furniture for teleportation and curse tactics
# - Market Futures can create tactical repositioning opportunities
# - Auction Curse benefits from the predictable furniture placement
# - Divine Depreciation can affect multiple furniture pieces at once
# - The pit creates natural territorial boundaries
