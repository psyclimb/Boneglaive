# AI Implementation Plan for Boneglaive

## Overview
This document outlines the approach for implementing AI opponents in Boneglaive, allowing for single-player gameplay against computer-controlled opponents.

## Design Goals
1. Provide engaging opponents without requiring perfect tactics
2. Create multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
3. Support different AI styles based on unit types (GLAIVEMAN, GRAYMAN, MANDIBLE_FOREMAN)
4. Maintain the existing game structure while adding AI capabilities
5. Modular design to allow for future improvements and AI strategy expansion

## Implementation Architecture

### 1. New Classes Structure
```
boneglaive/
└── ai/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── ai_player.py         # Main AI player class to make decisions
    ├── ai_interface.py      # Interface between AI and game engine
    ├── decision.py          # Decision representation classes
    ├── evaluator.py         # Board state evaluation functions
    ├── strategies/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── strategy.py      # Base strategy interface
    │   ├── basic.py         # Basic generic strategy for all units
    │   ├── glaiveman.py     # GLAIVEMAN-specific strategies
    │   ├── grayman.py       # GRAYMAN-specific strategies
    │   └── mandible.py      # MANDIBLE_FOREMAN-specific strategies
    └── difficulty.py        # Difficulty level implementations
```

### 2. Integration Points

1. **Network Interface Abstraction**:
   - Extend the `NetworkInterface` class to include an `AIInterface` implementation
   - This allows the AI to plug into the existing multiplayer framework

2. **Configuration System**:
   - Add AI options to the config system (difficulty level, AI type)
   - Update the network mode to include a "vs_ai" option

3. **Game Engine Updates**:
   - Minimal changes to the `Game` class to support AI turn processing
   - Add hooks to notify the AI when it's time to make a decision

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Framework
- Create the AI package structure
- Implement `AIInterface` class extending `NetworkInterface`
- Add configuration options for AI difficulty
- Implement basic decision-making framework

### Phase 2: Basic Strategy
- Implement the simplest AI strategy for making valid moves
- Focus on fundamental actions (movement, attacks)
- Add basic target selection logic
- Ensure the AI can complete a full game without errors

### Phase 3: Unit-Specific Strategies
- Implement specialized strategies for each unit type
- Add skill usage logic
- Improve tactical decision-making

### Phase 4: Difficulty Levels
- Implement different difficulty settings
- Add uncertainty/mistakes to make easier difficulty levels more beatable
- Fine-tune the hardest difficulty for challenging gameplay

### Phase 5: Testing & Refinement
- Playtest against different AI difficulty levels
- Balance AI strategies
- Fix any issues with AI behavior

## Technical Details

### AI Decision Process
1. **Analyze Game State**:
   - Current unit positions
   - Health and status effects
   - Available actions (moves, attacks, skills)

2. **Generate Possible Moves**:
   - For each unit, generate valid moves
   - For each move, generate possible attacks/skills
   - Create a decision tree of possibilities

3. **Evaluate Options**:
   - Score each possible move sequence
   - Consider both immediate benefits and strategic positioning
   - Apply difficulty-based randomness to decision quality

4. **Execute Best Action**:
   - Select the highest-scoring move sequence
   - Send the appropriate commands to the game engine

### Difficulty Implementation
- **Easy**: Makes some random decisions, doesn't use skills optimally, prefers simple attacks
- **Medium**: Makes mostly good decisions, uses skills when obvious, some tactical awareness
- **Hard**: Optimal play, proper skill usage, considers multiple turns ahead

## Next Steps
1. Create the initial AI package and core classes
2. Implement the AI interface to plug into the existing multiplayer system
3. Test with a "random move" AI to verify framework
4. Begin implementing basic strategy logic
5. Gradually enhance with unit-specific tactics
