# LAN Networking Implementation Plan

## Overview
Complete LAN multiplayer implementation for Boneglaive2, ensuring both players see identical game states at all times.

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED PHASES

### Phase 1: Chat & Message Foundation ‚úÖ
- Basic LAN connection (host/client)
- Chat message exchange
- Network message types and handlers

### Phase 2: Game State Synchronization ‚úÖ  
- Basic game state sync between players
- Player action transmission (move, attack, etc.)
- Setup phase synchronization

### Phase 3: Turn Control System ‚úÖ
- Proper turn switching in network games
- Turn transition messages
- Player turn validation

### Phase 4: Message Log Synchronization ‚úÖ
- Turn-based message batching
- Bidirectional message sync (P1‚ÜîP2)
- Automatic parity checking with recovery
- Message log desync detection and repair

## üöß CURRENT PHASE

### Phase 5: Complete Game State Parity ‚è≥
**CRITICAL**: Ensure both players have identical game states at all times

#### 5.1 Game State Serialization
- Serialize complete game state (units, HP, positions, status effects, terrain)
- Create deterministic game state checksum system
- Implement game state comparison utilities

#### 5.2 Turn-End Game State Sync
- Batch complete game state at end of each turn (like message batching)
- Send game state checksum with each turn transition
- Verify both players have identical game state after each turn

#### 5.3 Automatic Game State Recovery
- Detect game state desync via checksum mismatch
- Request full game state from authoritative player (host)
- Replace local game state with authoritative version
- Handle recovery during active gameplay

#### 5.4 Critical Game Event Synchronization
- HP changes (damage, healing, regeneration)
- Status effects (application, duration, removal)
- Unit deaths and resurrections
- Terrain effects and changes
- Skill cooldowns and charges
- Turn counters and game timers

## üìã FUTURE PHASES

### Phase 6: Network Resilience
- Connection drop detection
- Reconnection handling
- Game state persistence during disconnection
- Graceful degradation to single player

### Phase 7: Performance Optimization
- Reduce network message frequency
- Delta-based state updates (only send changes)
- Message compression for large states
- Network bandwidth monitoring

### Phase 8: Advanced Features
- Spectator mode support
- Save/load networked games
- Network game replays
- Advanced debugging tools

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Phase 5 Complete When:
- [ ] Both players always have identical HP values for all units
- [ ] Status effects are perfectly synchronized (type, duration, stacks)
- [ ] All combat damage/healing appears identically on both screens
- [ ] Terrain effects affect both players identically
- [ ] Game state checksum always matches between players
- [ ] Automatic recovery works when desync is detected
- [ ] No gameplay divergence possible between players

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Game State Sync Pattern (Same as Message Log)
1. **Turn Start**: Clear game state collection
2. **During Turn**: Track all game state changes locally
3. **Turn End**: After all effects resolve, create game state snapshot
4. **Network Sync**: Send complete game state + checksum to other player
5. **Parity Check**: Verify both players have identical state
6. **Recovery**: Auto-fix any detected desync

This ensures the same reliable synchronization we achieved with message logs, but applied to the entire game state.
