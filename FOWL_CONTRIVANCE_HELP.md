- High movement allows for repositioning between artillery strikes

## Tactical Notes
- **Strong against:** Clustered enemies, static formations, low-mobility units, units with high defence
- **Vulnerable to:** High-mobility rushers, units that can close distance quickly, area denial, high burst damage
- **Best positioning:** Behind cover, near rail network access points for quick repositioning
