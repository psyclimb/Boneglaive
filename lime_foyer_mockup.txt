# Description:
# - Roughly 50% of floor tiles have light lime dusting (,)
# - The dustings form windswept patterns suggesting air movement through the foyer
# - Clean areas (.) appear in sheltered spots or high-traffic paths that get cleaned
# - Heavier limestone piles (▒) block movement and are strategically placed
# - Two imposing round pillars (O) create major architectural features:
#   - Top pillar: 3x3 formation (rows 2-4, columns 7-9)
#   - Bottom pillar: 3x5 formation (rows 7-9, columns 7-11)
# - Foyer furniture is positioned throughout:
#   - Entry console table (◙) near the entrance
#   - Coat racks (┃) along the top wall
#   - Benches (■) for visitors
#   - Decorative tables (▥) displaying items
# - The windswept dust patterns flow from the corners inward
# - Some swirl patterns form around the pillars as would happen naturally

# Gameplay Considerations:
# - Light dustings (,) are visual only and don't affect movement
# - The dust patterns create a strong environmental storytelling element
# - Blocked tiles (▒ and O) create tactical terrain
# - The layout suggests natural wind patterns through the space
# - The design creates a lived-in, dynamic environment
